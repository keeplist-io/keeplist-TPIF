# Tiered Privacy

## Restoring Trust in the Digital Age

A Decentralized Framework for Identity and Authenticity Online

# The Internet's Trust Problem

The urgent need for trust in an inauthentic world:

- Nearly **50%** of internet traffic comes from automated sources
- **30%** of this traffic is malicious (Imperva, 2024)
- The line between real and fake is increasingly blurring
- Algorithmic manipulation and narrative amplification is rampant
- "Blue checkmarks" and other verification systems often mislead rather than inform

<!-- Speaker notes -->
<!-- Mention the $78 billion lost to identity theft in 2023 alone -->

---

# Reclaiming Authentic Anonymity

<div class="columns">
<div>

- The early internet was built on anonymity with assumed authenticity
- Today's online interactions require cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Privacy and trust are not mutually exclusive
- We need a user-centric approach that balances privacy, trust, and usability

</div>
<div>

<div class="quote">
"We need to cryptographically prove authenticity without sacrificing privacy, while balancing usability and accessibility for widespread adoption."
</div>

<!-- _class: overview -->

# Current Solutions Fall Short

<div class="columns">
<div>

**Centralized identity systems:**
- Privacy risks and surveillance potential
- Single points of failure
- Data breaches and identity theft
- Users forced to share all or no data

</div>
<div>

**Biometric approaches (e.g., Worldcoin):**
- Hardware limitations create access barriers
- Ethical concerns around biometric data
- Regulatory pushback globally
- Centralized control of sensitive data

</div>
</div>

---

# Worldcoin: A Cautionary Tale

- Centralized biometric identity platform requiring iris scans
- For-profit entity controlling all verification hardware and data
- Creates single point of failure and risk of abuse
- Led to regulatory investigations and halts in multiple countries
- Directly contradicts principles of decentralization and data minimization

# Introducing TPIF

**T**iered **P**rivacy and **I**dentity **F**ramework

- A spectrum of verification options, not a binary system
- User control over personal data disclosure
- Strong cryptographic foundations
- Decentralized, consortium-governed structure
- Universal Proof-of-Personhood as a foundation

![bg right:30% 80%](https://via.placeholder.com/500x300?text=Privacy+Spectrum)

---

# Core Principles

1. **Preserve Online Freedom**
   - Keep the internet accessible, decentralized, and equitable

2. **Build Trust Without Compromise**
   - Use cryptography to verify authenticity without revealing data

3. **Raise the Cost of Abuse**
   - Make automated manipulation difficult and expensive

4. **Support Context-Specific Verification**
   - Flexible tiers for different situations and preferences

5. **Enable Secure Anonymous Communication**
   - Protection in politically compromised environments

# The 5 Tiers of Privacy

A flexible framework that adapts to different contexts and user needs, governed by community consensus

![width:800px height:80vh](https://via.placeholder.com/800x150?text=Privacy+Tiers+Spectrum)

<!-- Emphasize this is not a hierarchy but a spectrum of options -->

---

<!-- _class: tier-1 -->

# Tier 1: Anonymous but Authentic

- Complete anonymity with proof of humanity
- Free and universal foundation
- Zero personal information shared
- "Digital birthright" for all users

**Applications:**
- Whistleblowing and reporting corruption
- Political speech in sensitive contexts
- Communication under oppressive regimes
- Research on sensitive topics

<!-- Draw parallel to physical world: like being in a public square without ID -->

---

<!-- _class: tier-2 -->

# Tier 2: Anonymous but Unique

- Session-based uniqueness for specific interactions
- Prevents multiple accounts/votes without tracking
- Verify credential validity without revealing content
- Like a "fairground token" that proves entry without identifying you

**Applications:**
- "One person, one vote" systems
- Limited-time offers without persistent accounts
- Anonymous contests and giveaways
- Temporary access systems

<!-- Explain the "fairground token" analogy from the white paper -->

---

<!-- _class: tier-3 -->

# Tier 3: Pseudonymous Presence

- Persistent identity within a specific context
- Build reputation and history over time
- No link to real-world identity
- Consistent across sessions on a platform

**Applications:**
- Online marketplaces (buyer/seller reputation)
- Community forums and discussion boards
- Subscription services
- Persistent platform-specific identities

<!-- Like having a username on Reddit or eBay -->

---

<!-- _class: tier-4 -->

# Tier 4: Moderated Identity

- Third-party verification of specific credentials
- Selective disclosure of verified attributes
- Control over what information is shared with whom
- Link to real-world credentials without full exposure

**Applications:**
- Professional license verification (doctors, lawyers)
- Proving ownership of assets without full identification
- Controlled access to regulated services
- Privacy-preserving KYC/AML compliance

<!-- Compare to showing just part of your driver's license -->

---

<!-- _class: tier-5 -->

# Tier 5: Public Identity

- Full transparency and accountability
- Real-world identity linked to online presence
- Maximum public trust and verification
- For public-facing roles and official communications

**Applications:**
- Public figure verification
- Government and official accounts
- High-security contexts
- Public trust roles

<!-- Like having a public notarized identity -->

---

# TPIF's Core Components

How does TPIF achieve this tiered privacy? Through these key components:

- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Tiered spectrum of association with real identity
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Tamper-proof credentials from trusted issuers
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** User ownership and control of digital identity
- **Universal Proof-of-Personhood:** PoP verification required across all tiers
- **Permissioned Blockchain:** Consortium-governed infrastructure
- **FHE-Protected Audit Logs:** Privacy-preserving verification records

<!-- Explain how these components work together -->

---

# Advanced Cryptographic Technologies

<div class="columns">
<div>

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**
- Prove facts without revealing data
- Example: Proving you're over 21 without revealing birthdate

**Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC):**
- Verification Oracles collaborate without seeing complete data

</div>
<div>

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):**
- Compute on encrypted data, enabling "eventual privacy"

**Onion Routing (Mix Network):**
- Network-level anonymity for all communications

</div>
</div>

<!-- Use analogies: ZKP is like proving you know a password without saying it -->

---

# System Architecture

Key flow:
1. User initiates login with TPIF
2. Verification oracles selected
3. Credentials verified via ZKPs
4. Results returned without exposing user data

<!-- Walk through the diagram following the login flow -->

---

# Privacy-Preserving Login Protocol

1. User initiates login with "Login with TPIF"
2. Client generates a random SessionID
3. Communication routed through Mix Network (onion encryption)
4. Smart contract randomly selects Verification Oracles
5. Client generates ZKPs for required credentials
6. Oracles verify credentials via MPC without seeing data
7. Verification result sent to Relying Party
8. FHE-protected audit logs maintain accountability

<!-- Highlight that at no point is user data exposed to any single entity -->
